## Brochureware

Some websites I create are often brochureware. The website material is text with graphics and links sprinkled in.

I am hesitant creating brochureware websites without using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) . It is quicker creating web pages using Markdown than HTML.

## Troika

The troika of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) website programming languages have become standard for creating website pages, They are interpreted and rendered by web browsers.

The job of a blog or website development frameworks is to compile the troika and non troika programming languages, such as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), into a combination of standard troika languages to be executed by web browsers.

## Markdown

Markdown has a useful feature of enabling HTML syntax to be easily intermixed with Markdown syntax. 

Most flavors of Markdown do not support image height or width attributes. An example using HTML embedded in Markdown is 

```This image <img src="whatever.png" height=400 width=400 /> is beautiful.```

## mdBook

The reincarnation of [JohnTelford](https://johntelford.com) at the time of this posting, is created using mdBook

[mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is a command line tool to create books or brochureware with Markdown.

- Lightweight Markdown syntax helps focus more on content
- Integrated search support
- Color syntax highlighting for code blocks for many different languages
- Theme files allow customizing the formatting of the output
- Preprocessors can provide extensions for custom syntax and modifying content
- Backends can render the output to multiple formats
- Written in Rust for speed, safety, and simplicity

The mdBook Documentation is an example of what mdBook produces.

MdBook does not abstract React and create web components using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#Next.js-focus-wrapper) (JavaScript eXtended). More about this later when [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is discussed
